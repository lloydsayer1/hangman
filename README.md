## Project Description

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

ask_for_input() - Asks the user to enter a letter and checks if the input is only 1 character long and is contained within the alphabet.

check_guess() - Takes the users validated input from ask_for_input and prints whether that letter is in the word they need to guess or not.
